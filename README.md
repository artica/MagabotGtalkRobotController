MagabotGtalkRobotController
===========================

This application creates an interface between Google Chat and the robot, working as a Google Chat client on your computer. When you choose to give control of the robot to someone who is chatting with you, that person can start to control the robot by sending messages with a single character which the application sends by serial to the robot.
